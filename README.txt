A set of tools for managing windows binary egg building.

Detailed documentation at:
http://docs.zope.org/zopetoolkit/process/winbotsetup.html

Note that this project is now obsolete, as the Zope Foundation is no longer
operating the winbot.zope.org host which used the project to build and
publish Windows eggs / installers.
