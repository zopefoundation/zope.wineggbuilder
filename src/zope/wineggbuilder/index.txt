Building windows binary eggs
============================

This package will build missing binary eggs for specified platforms and package
versions.

A overview how it works::

  - It gets all the released versions from pypi with an xmlrpc query
    (with the method package_releases).

  - Optionally filters the versions (See the specs for
    version/platform constraints)

  - Checks if there are binary eggs present for the various versions/platforms.

  - If one is missing, builds it and uploads to pypi (setup.py bdist_egg),
    taking the source from the svn tag.


Config file
-----------

Standard ini file format is used.
For samples see ``test.ini`` and ``rackspace.ini``.

``build`` section
..................

- ``compilers`` - Specify the section names of the compilers (python
                  interpreters) to be used.
                  Multiple items, separated by whitespace

Compiler section
................

The section name should match one of the ``compilers`` option entry.

- ``command`` - Specify the command(s) needed to compile AND upload the package.
                If there's only one line, it's executed directly.
                More lines are accepted. They are written to a temp .bat file
                and the .bat file is executed.

- ``fileEnding`` - Specify the last characters of the egg filename for the
                   given platform.

Package section
...............

All the remaining sections are used as package specifications.
A good idea is to name the section as the package plus some version info.

- ``package`` - Specify the package name, as it is used on pypi.

- ``minVersion`` - Specify the minimum version to be processed. (>=)

- ``maxVersion`` - Specify the maximum version to be processed. (<=)

- ``targets`` - Specify the target platforms/compilers.
                Separate entries by whitespace.

- ``pypiurl`` - Specify the location of the release files on pypi.
                Default is: http://pypi.python.org/simple/<package>/

- ``tagurl`` - Specify the location of the sourcecode.
               Currently only svn is supported.
               Default is: svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/<package>/tags
               The package version gets appended to the end for the
               ``svn co`` command. The full url is then:
               svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/<package>/tags/<version>

- ``needSource`` - Boolean switch. If true there must be a .zip/.tar.gz/.tgz
                   release file present on pypi, otherwise nothing will be done.
                   Default is: True

- ``excludeVersions`` - Specify which exact versions to exclude from compiling.
                        Separate multiple values by whitespace.

Commandline options
-------------------

Deployment is the usual buildout way:

  c:\eggbuild> python bootstrap.py
  c:\eggbuild> bin\buildout.exe

The script to start is then:

  c:\eggbuild> bin\build.exe

  Usage: build-script.py [options]

  Options:
    -h, --help     show this help message and exit
    -q, --quiet    When specified, no messages are displayed.
    -v, --verbose  When specified, debug information is displayed.
    -d, --dryrun   When specified, no upload is done.
    -s, --status   When specified, detailed status is output at the end.
